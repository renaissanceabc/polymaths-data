  Jimmy Wales attended a Montessori preschool and has spoken positively about the method's influence. He credited
  Montessori's child-led learning philosophy as a foundation for his intellectual curiosity and love of self-directed
  study. As a child, he spent hours poring over encyclopediasâ€”a habit he links to his later creation of Wikipedia.
