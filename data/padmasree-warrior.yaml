quotes:
  - "Walking into ambiguous situations and being comfortable with that is hugely helpful with my job,” she said. “Most
    executives want everything laid out clearly with all the i's dotted and t's crossed. But the real world is not like
    that. In my job, setting the technology direction for a massive technology company, you only get so much
    information, and at some point you have to make decisions and be comfortable with that. That's something I learned
    early on."
